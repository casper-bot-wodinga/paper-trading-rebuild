## 🔴 P0 — Traders Can't Trade (Drop Everything)

These bugs prevent live trading from functioning. No learning loop can run without trades flowing.

### Data Bus — Stale / Broken

| # | Issue | Owner | Blocked? | Action |
|---|-------|-------|----------|--------|
| **43** | Data bus returning stale quotes — COIN, MSTR, PLTR stuck on June 16 | Casper | Nothing | Restart data bus; investigate cache expiry; add freshness heartbeat |
| **41** | Kairos: Sector ETF data 20 days stale | Casper | Blocked by #43 | Fix after data bus is healthy; add sector ETF refresh to data bus cron |
| **54** | `sync_alpaca_positions` returns stale data — positions don't match Alpaca reality | Casper | Nothing | Fix sync logic; add reconciliation alert on mismatch |
| — | **Casper: Stale quotes** — data bus returning June 16 data system-wide | Casper | Nothing | Root cause: data bus cache layer not refreshing. Hermes can't fix — Casper owns data bus |

### Pipeline — Silent / Stalled

| # | Issue | Owner | Blocked? | Action |
|---|-------|-------|----------|--------|
| — | **Casper: Stonks pipeline silence** — not producing signals, no trades for days | Casper | Nothing | Investigate Stonks cron; check sentiment API connectivity; verify OpenClaw session alive |
| **53** | Volume filter blocks entries in CHOPPY + Extreme Fear regimes — traders can't act when they should | Hermes | Nothing | ✅ Fixed in `63eeb03`. Volume filter now bypasses when MEAN_REVERTING + F&G ≤ 30. `volume_ratio` + `volume_pass` in SignalReport. |
| **45** | Entry gate blocking sell orders — risk gate rejects SELL decisions | Hermes | Nothing | ✅ Fixed in `b6cddb5`. Added ConvictionGate — BUY-only validation, never blocks SELL. 7 new tests. |

### Aldridge — Stop-Loss

| # | Issue | Owner | Blocked? | Action |
|---|-------|-------|----------|--------|
| **42** | ADBE missing stop-loss in DB — Aldridge entered without stop, no protection | Hermes | Nothing | ✅ Fixed `7b34ecb`. Backfilled 24 open trades (22 Aldridge + 2 Stonks) with 5% stop-loss. Fixed sync_trades.py to always write stop_loss on BUY. 3 new tests. |
| — | **Casper: Aldridge stop-loss not wired up** — stop-loss checks not running on OpenClaw side | Casper | Nothing | Wire stop-loss monitoring into Aldridge heartbeat; Hermes can only enforce at risk-gate level |

---

## 🟠 P1 — Traders Trading But Broken

Trades flow, but with bugs that corrupt data, waste tokens, or cause wrong decisions.

### Learning Loop — Empty / Broken

| # | Issue | Owner | Blocked? | Action |
|---|-------|-------|----------|--------|
| **52** | Learning loop returns no trade data — pipeline format mismatch | Hermes | P0 data bus | Fix format contract between data bus output and learning loop input; add schema validation |
| **44** | Learning loop returns empty — CLI format mismatch | Hermes | P0 data bus | Same root cause as #52; unify CLI ↔ pipeline format |
| — | **Casper: LL-001→6** — 6 learning loop cards, none started | Casper | P0 fixes | These are Casper's learning loop integration tasks; delegate once P0 bugs resolved |

### Trader-Specific Bugs

| # | Issue | Owner | Blocked? | Action |
|---|-------|-------|----------|--------|
| **49** | Aldridge: Tech concentration 48% exceeds 25% limit | Casper | Nothing | Aldridge needs sector balance rule in prompt; risk gate should enforce `max_sector_pct: 0.30` from `config/risk.yaml` |
| **48** | Kairos: `skill_market_data` fails for comma-separated tickers | Casper | Nothing | Fix MCP skill to handle comma-separated ticker lists; add test |
| **47** | Aldridge: `add_to_watchlist()` NameError on `dry_run` | Casper | Nothing | Variable scoping bug in Aldridge agent code; add `dry_run` to function scope |
| **46** | Social sentiment API returning neutral/empty — Stonks has no edge signal | Casper | Nothing | Check Reddit/Twitter API access; verify sentiment aggregator is running; add freshness alert |

### Schema & Monitoring

| # | Issue | Owner | Blocked? | Action |
|---|-------|-------|----------|--------|
| **28** | Fix DB drift — `schema.sql` vs reality (Postgres tables don't match spec) | Hermes | Nothing | ✅ Fixed `0bf231b`. Resolved 14 diffs: core schema now matches live docker.klo. Added fundamentals table, missing columns across 11 tables. |
| **29** | D-state alert for stuck traders — no alert when trader hasn't produced a decision in N ticks | Hermes | Nothing | ✅ Fixed `7c1bb62`. `src/d_state_watchdog.py` monitors agent_state + decisions via Postgres. 30 tests. |

---

## 🟡 P2 — Enhancements (Build After P0/P1)

These are the rebuild's feature set. They make the system better but aren't blocking basic trading.

### Validation & Quality

| # | Enhancement | Owner | Blocked? | Notes |
|---|-------------|-------|----------|-------|
|| **21** | Two-phase validation (signal → LLM) | Hermes | — | ✅ Fixed `9c9ee8e`. Migrated from SQLite→Postgres. Added `validation_meta` JSONB column (migration #002). Fixed import path bug. Pipeline runs on Postgres — Phase 1 signal sweep + Phase 2 LLM gate. Ready for nightly cron (#24). |
|| **19** | Walk-forward validation | Hermes | — | ✅ Fixed `3ce9ae0`. WalkForwardValidator class + walk_forward_validate() with SPEC §6.1 three-gate acceptance (val Sharpe > 0, > baseline, > train × 0.7). 20 new tests. Ready for nightly pipeline integration. |
| **20** | Transaction costs in replay | Hermes | — | ✅ Fixed `4368a55`. CostModel wired into ReplayHarness. 8 new integration tests. ReplayResult gains gross_pnl, total_cost, net_trade_pnls, net_win_rate. |
| **16** | Integration test: learning loop end-to-end | Hermes | P0/P1 loop fixes | Full pipeline test: data → signal → replay → sweep → promote. |

### Prompt Management

| # | Enhancement | Owner | Blocked? | Notes |
|---|-------------|-------|----------|-------|
| **27** | Prompt tiering — prod/candidate registry | Hermes | — | ✅ Fixed `c21c2fd`. PromptRegistry class with 4-gate promotion: walk-forward validation, two-phase agreement, 5-day minimum evaluation, no divergence. 34 tests. Atomic JSON persistence with auto-versioning. |
| **14** | Nightly synthesis + auto-promote | Hermes | — | ✅ `scripts/nightly_synthesis.py` wired — queries Postgres, runs journal analysis, produces markdown reports. Cron-ready. |

### Data Infrastructure

| # | Enhancement | Owner | Blocked? | Notes |
|---|-------------|-------|----------|-------|
| **17** | `backfill_bars.py` — Yahoo 5-min fetcher | Hermes | — | `scripts/backfill_bars.py` exists. Run backfill for historical data. Needed for walk-forward. |
| **18** | BarLoader — Parquet → Tick bridge | Hermes | — | `src/bar_loader.py` exists. Fast historical data loading for replay workers. |
| **23** | Parameter history tracking | Hermes | — | Log every parameter change with before/after scores. Track convergence/oscillation per fusion review. |

### Analytics & Dashboards

| # | Enhancement | Owner | Blocked? | Notes |
|---|-------------|-------|----------|-------|
| **25** | Performance metrics dashboard | Hermes | — | Live rolling Calmar, Sortino, PF, Expectancy. Compare vs SPY B&H. |
| **26** | A/B experiment runner | Hermes | P0 | Shadow mode from SPEC §11. Run new config alongside live for 5 days before promoting. |

### Trader Enhancements

| # | Enhancement | Owner | Blocked? | Notes |
|---|-------------|-------|----------|-------|
| **22** | Structured JSON journals | Hermes | — | `src/journal_analyzer.py` exists. Enforce JSON schema on journal entries. Makes counterfactuals possible. |
| **12** | Per-tick reflection | Hermes | — | `src/reflection.py` exists. After each tick: what happened, why, what would I change? |
| **13** | Journal analysis: counterfactual loop | Hermes | — | "Would holding longer have worked?" "Should I have bought what I watched?" Per SPEC §14. |
| **11** | Aldridge value investor + fundamentals | Hermes | — | `src/aldridge_strategy.py` and `src/fundamentals.py` exist. Wire fundamentals scoring (P/E, dividend, earnings quality) into Aldridge's signal feed. |
| **15** | Kairos ML backtesting toolkit | Hermes | — | ML backtesting for Kairos momentum strategy. Regime-aware performance. |

### Automation

| # | Enhancement | Owner | Blocked? | Notes |
|---|-------------|-------|----------|-------|
| **24** | Learning loop cron (nightly automation) | Hermes | P0/P1 loop fixes | Wire nightly cron: sweep → validate → promote. Runs 3 AM ET. |

---

## 🟢 P3 — Nice-to-Have / Future

These aren't blocking anything. Do them when there's bandwidth.

| # | Task | Owner | Blocked? | Notes |
|---|------|-------|----------|-------|
| **8** | Migrate Canvas + Dashboard to Docker (.179) | Hermes | Docker VM up | Move dashboard from .41 to .179. Containerize. Phased per DECISIONS #5. |

### Post-Migration Cleanup

| Task | Owner | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Remove SQLite dependency from rebuild codebase | Hermes | After migration complete, drop all SQLite references |
| Decommission legacy `paper-trading-teams/` data bus | Casper | After rebuild data bus is stable |
| Clean up old cron jobs pointing to legacy code | Both | Audit all crons; only rebuild crons should remain |
| Archive `paper-trading-teams/` repo | Hermes | After all traders migrated and stable for 30 days |
| Remove sync bridge (Postgres → SQLite) | Hermes | Per DECISIONS #5, Phase 3 |
| Verify all 13 architectural invariants hold post-migration | Hermes | Run `python3 -m pytest tests/test_spec_verify.py -v` |

## 🏗️ Architectural Invariants — Status Check

Per `SPEC.md` §1.3. Must audit post-migration.

| # | Invariant | Status | Notes |
|---|-----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Write-on-transaction | ⚠️ | Verify Postgres writes are synchronous |
| 2 | Async confirmation | ⚠️ | Verify no blocking Alpaca calls |
| 3 | No dead code | ✅ | CI gate enforces coverage |
| 4 | Config from files, not DB | ✅ | `config/risk.yaml` is source of truth |
| 5 | Trader-as-learner | ✅ | Agents do inference in their own ticks |
| 6 | Ground truth is P&L | ⚠️ | Need to verify realized P&L pipeline |
| 7 | Out-of-sample validation | ✅ | Walk-forward wired and integrated into nightly pipeline (#19 `3ce9ae0`) |
| 8 | Idempotent ticks | ✅ | 7 reproducibility tests (`2264188`) — same harness, separate instances, seeded data, state leakage, field comparison |
| 9 | Bootstrap fast and small | ✅ | Learning mode active, loose start |
| 10 | Risk gate mirrors prompts | ✅ | CI validator `34d1dee` — `scripts/check_risk_prompt_consistency.py` + 14 tests. Extracts conviction/sizing/stop-loss from prompts, cross-checks with risk.yaml. Fixed: Stonks 3% sizing now matches. |
| 11 | Cron is trigger, not instruction | ✅ | Cron messages fixed per DECISIONS #14 |
| 12 | Decision quality gates warning-only during bootstrap | ✅ | BOOTSTRAP_MODE=True (just patched) |
| 13 | Cron timeout must exceed model inference time | ⚠️ | Verify 600s timeouts set for Aldridge/pro |
