```

**Speed 1 — Intraday parameter tuning (gradient descent):**
- Runs every trading tick (3-4x per market day)
- Finite-difference gradient on signal engine parameters
- Small steps, bounded ranges, safe defaults
- Only adjusts numerical parameters; never touches prompts

**Speed 2 — Nightly prompt evolution (parallel sweep):**
- After market close, replay yesterday's data 100+ times
- Each replay: different prompt variant OR tool configuration
- Fan-out across Docker/Ollama/OpenClaw workers
- Rank by objective score on replay data
- Best variant > original? Auto-PR to agents repo
- If no variant beats original, journal "no improvement found"

**Speed 3 — Weekly code changes (serial coder):**
- Nightly pipeline detects structural improvements needed
- Coder agent writes actual code changes, commits as PR
- Hermes + Casper review and merge
- Runs on weekend or low-cost hours

### 1.2 Distributed Hardware

| Machine | Role | Resources |
|---------|------|-----------|
| **Hermes** (.131) | Orchestrator, spec-keeper, PR reviewer | Coordinates, fixes breakages |
| **OpenClaw** (.41) | Agent host — traders live here | Claude/Gemini via API |
| **Docker** (.179) | Backtest workers, replay harness | 20 parallel containers |
| **Mac** (.237) | Ollama inference for prompt sweeps | Free local inference |
| **TrueNAS** (.96) | Data lake | Historical data, trade DB, equity curves |

Data flow: TrueNAS stores everything. Every machine mounts it. Replay harness reads historical data from TrueNAS. Docker workers write results back. Hermes reads results from TrueNAS to generate PRs.

### 1.3 Architectural Invariants

These cannot be violated. All code and PRs are audited against them.

1. **Write-on-transaction**: Every state change writes to DB before returning. No in-memory-only state.
2. **Async confirmation**: No blocking on external APIs. Fire, record intent, confirm later.
3. **No dead code**: Every code path is exercised by at least one test. Coverage gate in CI.
4. **Config from files, not DB**: All trader configs live in git. The DB holds data, not settings.
5. **Trader-as-learner**: Agents do inference in their own ticks. No separate learning pipeline that feeds results back.
6. **Ground truth is P&L**: All improvement is measured by realized P&L outcomes. Heuristic scores are diagnostic only, never the optimization target.
7. **Out-of-sample validation**: No parameter change is accepted without validation on data the optimizer hasn't seen.
8. **Idempotent ticks**: Running the same tick twice produces the same result. No side effects that depend on timing.
9. **Bootstrap fast and small**: Every new trading agent or strategy begins with cheap stocks ($10-40 range), small positions (1-2% equity), low confidence thresholds (0.30), and permissive filters. The learning loop tightens parameters — not the starting prompt. A conservative start starves the optimizer of data. A loose start lets the optimizer discover what works, then narrow toward it. This applies to any new strategy we add (options, swing trading, sector rotation, etc.) — always begin noisy, let the data teach precision.
10. **Risk gate mirrors prompts**: The risk gate configuration (`config/risk.yaml`) is a derivative of trader prompts, not an independent policy. Conviction thresholds, position caps, and sizing limits in the gate MUST match what the prompts tell traders. Changing one requires changing the other. CI enforces this — any prompt change that widens a gap between prompt rules and gate rules fails the build. The trader must never face a gate it can't see.
11. **Cron is trigger, not instruction**: Cron inline messages are nudges — "Execute your routine. Follow your prompt." They do NOT specify strategy, stock universe, entry rules, or sizing. Those live in prompt.txt alone. Changing strategy requires editing prompt.txt, not every cron job. A cron message that contradicts prompt.txt is a spec violation.
12. **Decision quality gates are warning-only during bootstrap**: During the first 30 closed trades or until portfolio reaches +5% equity, the thesis/signals_used/exit_condition requirements downgrade from VETO (reject trade) to WARNING (log and proceed). We need data more than we need format correctness. After bootstrap completes, the gate upgrades to VETO — format is mandatory once there's a track record to protect.
13. **Cron timeout must exceed model inference time**: The slowest call in any tick pipeline (LLM inference) must fit within the cron timeout with 3× buffer. A 180s timeout with a reasoning model that takes 120s+ is guaranteed failure. Minimum: model's P99 latency × 3. Kairos runs on flash (fast), Aldridge on pro (slow → needs 600s timeout), Stonks on flash.

## §2 — Objective Function

### 2.1 Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Weight | Why |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|
| **Calmar ratio** | annualized_return ÷ abs(max_drawdown) | 0.40 | Balances return and risk in one number. Rewards consistency. |
| **Sortino ratio** | (return - risk_free) ÷ downside_deviation | 0.15 | Like Sharpe but only penalizes downside volatility. Better for trading. |
| **Profit factor** | gross_profit ÷ gross_loss | 0.30 | "Do the wins outweigh the losses?" Pure edge detection. |
| **Expectancy** | total_pnl ÷ num_trades | 0.15 | "How much does each trade make on average?" Dollar-denominated. |

**Knockout condition**: If max_drawdown > 15%, objective_score = 0 regardless of other metrics. Trader is paused.

### 2.2 Composite Score

```
objective_score(trader, window_days=30) → float

Step 1: Compute rolling metrics over window_days
Step 2: Z-score expectancy against trader's own history (normalizes scale)
Step 3: Apply weights
Step 4: Apply knockout

Returns a single number. Higher = better. Zero = broken.
```

### 2.3 Benchmarks

Every night, compute the same metrics for **SPY buy-and-hold** over the identical period.

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Calmar < SPY Calmar | Signal: strategy underperforms benchmark. Optimizer proposes larger changes. |
| Calmar > SPY Calmar, improving | Signal: strategy has edge. Optimizer proposes fine-tuning. |
| Profit factor < 1.0 for 30 days | Signal: no edge. Trader journals "do I have a real strategy?" |

## §3 — Signal Engine (Gradient-Descent Tuned)

### 3.1 What Gets Tuned

The signal engine produces structured data that the LLM trader reads. All tunable parameters are continuous floats with bounded ranges.

```yaml
# Per-trader, version-controlled in agents repo
signal_params:
  momentum:
    threshold: 0.55          # float [0.3, 0.9]
    lookback_days: 20        # int [5, 60]
    decay_rate: 0.85         # float [0.5, 0.99]
    
  mean_reversion:
    rsi_oversold: 30.0       # float [15, 40]
    rsi_overbought: 70.0     # float [60, 85]
    bollinger_std: 2.0       # float [1.0, 3.0]
    
  volatility:
    regime_threshold: 0.25   # float [0.1, 0.5] — stddev daily returns
    reduction_multiplier: 0.7 # float [0.3, 1.0] — position size in high vol
    
  position_sizing:
    base_size_pct: 0.15      # float [0.05, 0.30] — % of equity per position
    conviction_multiplier: 1.5  # float [1.0, 3.0] — scale when conviction high
    max_positions: 5         # int [1, 10]
    
  risk:
    stop_loss_pct: 0.05      # float [0.02, 0.10]
    take_profit_pct: 0.15    # float [0.05, 0.30]
    trailing_stop_pct: 0.03  # float [0.01, 0.08]
    
  regime_weights:
    trending_up: 1.0         # float [0.2, 2.0]
    trending_down: 0.5       # float [0.0, 1.5]
    mean_reverting: 0.8      # float [0.2, 2.0]
    high_volatility: 0.4     # float [0.0, 1.0]
```

### 3.2 Finite-Difference Gradient Descent

Runs every trading tick:

```
for each param in signal_params:
    baseline_score = objective_score(trader, window_days=5)
    
    param += epsilon                    # perturb up
    replay_score_up = replay_last_n_ticks(trader, signal_params, n=10)
    
    param -= 2*epsilon                  # perturb down
    replay_score_down = replay_last_n_ticks(trader, signal_params, n=10)
    
    grad = (replay_score_up - replay_score_down) / (2 * epsilon)
    param += learning_rate * grad       # step toward improvement
    
    clip(param, bounds.min, bounds.max) # stay in safe range
```

Constraints:
- Learning rate: 0.01 per tick
- Max parameter change per tick: 5% of range
- Minimum 3 ticks between changes to the same parameter
- All changes logged with before/after scores

## §4 — LLM Trader (Prompt-Evolved)

### 4.1 Trader Tick Architecture (Ephemeral Ticks + Persistent Heartbeat)

**Trading decisions and reflection are different workloads. They run on different cadences, with different sessions.**

#### Trading Ticks — Ephemeral, Zero Cold Start

Each trading tick is a stateless cron job. A pre-tick script (`scripts/tick_prompt.py`) runs before the LLM is spawned:

```
Cron fires (e.g. */5 9-16 * * 1-5 for Kairos)
  → scripts/tick_prompt.py --trader kairos
    → reads prompts/kairos.txt (the template)
    → hits data bus for live state (portfolio, quotes, regime, F&G, signals)
    → templates everything into one complete prompt
    → returns the prompt string
  → Cron spawns agentTurn with the assembled prompt
  → LLM receives fully-loaded context — first thought is about trading
  → Outputs JSON: BUY/SELL/HOLD with thesis + signals
  → Tick done. Session discarded.
```

**The LLM never touches a tool during a trading tick.** It doesn't read files, doesn't query APIs, doesn't check its portfolio. All context arrives pre-assembled. The cron message IS the complete prompt.

**What's stable vs dynamic:**

| Layer | Source | Changes |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Strategy, persona, stock universe, rules | `prompts/{trader}.txt` | Nightly via sweep |
| Portfolio state, quotes, regime, F&G, signals | Data bus (live) | Every tick |
| Output format (JSON schema) | Prompt template | Rarely (coordinated with risk gate) |
| Journal context (last 5 entries) | Trader's journal DB | Every tick |

**Prompt text is LOCKED during market hours.** The template (`prompts/{trader}.txt`) does not change between 9:30 AM and 4:00 PM ET. Changes only go live overnight after the sweep validates them. This means: a trader's strategy is consistent all day. If a trader thinks "I should change X," it writes that in its journal — the heartbeat session captures it — and Hermes reviews it in the evening.

**Intervals per trader:**
| Trader | Interval | Model | Thinking | Why |
|--------|----------|-------|----------|-----|
| Kairos | 5 min | flash | low | Momentum — needs fresh data, fast decisions |
| Stonks | 15 min | flash | low | Sentiment — takes time to scan, gut feel |
| Aldridge | 30 min | pro | medium | Value — deliberate, fewer ticks |

**Timeout:** 600s for all ticks. With no tool calls and pre-assembled context, typical completion is 30-90s. The 600s ceiling is a safety net, not the target.

#### Heartbeat / Journal Sessions — Persistent, Reflection Only

Separate from trading ticks. Each trader has ONE persistent OpenClaw session that lives 9:30 AM → 4:00 PM ET. This session:

- **Journaling**: Writes reflections after each trade or at regular intervals
- **Learning**: "Here's what I noticed today. Here's what might improve."
- **Proposing changes**: "My stock universe should add X. My conviction floor should be Y."
- **Never executes trades**: The heartbeat session doesn't make BUY/SELL decisions

Changes proposed in journals are reviewed overnight by Hermes + Casper. If approved, the prompt template (`prompts/{trader}.txt`) is updated and takes effect the next trading day. Prompts NEVER change mid-day.

**Circuit breaker:** Max 50 turns per heartbeat session. After 50, self-terminates and respawns. Prevents long-session drift.

#### Cold Start Overhead Eliminated

The pre-tick script solves the cold start problem that made cron-based ticks impractical:

| Phase | Before (cold cron) | After (pre-assembled prompt) |
|-------|--------------------|------------------------------|
| Session init + tool mounting | 10-20s | 0s (tools not needed) |
| Read prompt + portfolio context | 30-60s | 0s (pre-assembled) |
| Model thinking | 1-5 min | 10-30s (context is complete) |
| Tool calls (data bus × 5) | 30-60s | 0s (data already in prompt) |
| Output + execution | 10-20s | 10-20s |
| **Total** | **2-7 min** | **20-50s** |

The 2026-07-06 timeout cascade (5+ consecutive failures at 180s) was driven entirely by cold-start overhead. Pre-assembled prompts eliminate every phase except model thinking + output.

### 4.2 Trader Decision Loop

Each tick (within the persistent session or cron fallback), the trader agent receives:

1. **Signal report**: Structured output from signal engine (momentum scores, RSI, regime, position sizing recommendations)
2. **Portfolio state**: Positions, cash, P&L, current drawdown
3. **Market context**: SPY trend, VIX level, sector rotation signals
4. **Journal**: Last 10 entries of the trader's own reflection log
5. **Signal board**: Other traders' recent observations (see §7)

The agent must output:
```json
{
  "decision": "BUY | SELL | HOLD",
  "ticker": "AAPL",
  "conviction": 0.72,
  "rationale": "Momentum signal 0.81, RSI at 42 (not overbought), SPY trending up. Regime: TRENDING_UP.",
  "signal_override": false,
  "override_reason": null
}
```

### 4.3 Prompt Structure

```
You are {trader_name}, a paper trading agent.

Strategy: {strategy_description}

Current regime: {regime}, confidence: {regime_confidence}

Signal Report:
{signal_report}

Portfolio:
{portfolio_state}

Other traders' observations:
{signals_board}

Your recent journal:
{journal_entries}

Make a trading decision. You CAN override the signal engine if your analysis disagrees.
If you override, explain why.
```

### 4.4 Nightly Prompt Sweep

After market close (16:00 ET):

```
Step 1: Record yesterday's full market data (prices, signals, decisions, outcomes)
Step 2: Generate N prompt variants (N = 20–100):
    - Rephrased strategy descriptions
    - Different emphasis (risk-focused, opportunity-focused, balanced)
    - Modified tool descriptions
    - Different journal prompts
Step 3: Fan out to workers:
    - Docker (.179): 20 parallel replay workers
    - Mac (.237): Ollama inference for cheaper runs
    - OpenClaw (.73): Claude/Gemini for high-quality variants
Step 4: Each worker replays yesterday's data with its prompt variant
Step 5: Rank all variants + original by objective_score on replay
Step 6: If best variant > original + threshold (1% improvement):
    - Create PR to agents repo with the winning prompt
    - Include replay metrics: "Original Calmar: 1.2, Variant #47 Calmar: 1.35"
    - Auto-merge if improvement > 5% and all tests pass
Step 7: If no variant beats original:
    - Journal: "Nightly sweep: 100 variants tested, none improved on baseline."
```

## §5 — Regime Detection

### 5.1 Regime Classifier

Simple, explainable, not an ML black box:

| Regime | Detection | What it means |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| **TRENDING_UP** | SPY > 20-day SMA AND ADX > 25 AND slope positive | Buy dips, ride momentum |
| **TRENDING_DOWN** | SPY < 20-day SMA AND ADX > 25 AND slope negative | Reduce positions, favor shorts |
| **MEAN_REVERTING** | ADX < 20 AND SPY within Bollinger Bands | Buy oversold, sell overbought |
| **HIGH_VOLATILITY** | VIX > 25 OR daily range > 2% | Reduce size, widen stops |

Regime is computed per tick and attached to every trade record. Performance is tracked per-regime so the optimizer knows "Kairos has Sharpe 1.8 in TRENDING_UP but -0.4 in MEAN_REVERTING."

### 5.2 Regime-Aware Parameters

Each trader can have different signal parameters per regime:

```yaml
regime_overrides:
  TRENDING_UP:
    momentum: {threshold: 0.55}
    position_sizing: {base_size_pct: 0.20}
  MEAN_REVERTING:
    momentum: {threshold: 0.35}
    position_sizing: {base_size_pct: 0.10}
  HIGH_VOLATILITY:
    position_sizing: {base_size_pct: 0.05}
    risk: {stop_loss_pct: 0.08}
```

The optimizer proposes regime-scoped changes. "In MEAN_REVERTING, reduce momentum threshold from 0.40 to 0.35" — not a global change.

---

## §6 — Validation & Overfitting Prevention

### 6.1 Walk-Forward Validation

Every parameter change must pass walk-forward validation:

```
Training window: [T-90 days, T-30 days]
Validation window: [T-30 days, T today]

Acceptance criteria:
  1. Validation Sharpe > 0 (positive on unseen data)
  2. Validation Sharpe > Baseline Sharpe (improved vs current params)
  3. Validation Sharpe > Training Sharpe × 0.7 (not grossly overfit)

If criteria fail: REJECT with reason.
If criteria pass: ACCEPT with confidence = validation_sharpe / training_sharpe.
```

### 6.2 Statistical Significance

Before accepting a parameter change, compute:

```
baseline_metrics = replay(trader, current_params, validation_window)
candidate_metrics = replay(trader, proposed_params, validation_window)

t_stat = (candidate_sharpe - baseline_sharpe) / pooled_std_error

if t_stat < 1.96:  # 95% confidence
    REJECT: "Improvement not statistically significant (p > 0.05)"
```

### 6.3 Minimum Evaluation Period

- Parameter changes are frozen for 5 trading days after acceptance
- No new proposals for the same parameter during the freeze
- After 5 days, the change is evaluated: did live performance match the validation prediction?
- If live performance degraded: auto-revert and flag

---

## §7 — Knowledge Sharing & Skill Evolution

### 7.0 Trader Skill Profiles

Each trader has a distinct starting toolkit. Tools are locked — a trader can't use what it doesn't have. But it can request access through the learning loop.

```
Trader skill profiles (initial):
  Kairos:   momentum_tools, RSI, MACD, volume_profile
  Aldridge: value_tools, P/E_screening, dividend_analysis, sector_rotation
  Stonks:   sentiment_tools, news_scraping, social_signals, fear_greed
```

**Tool request workflow:**
1. Trader journals: "I see a pattern I can't capture with my current tools. I need {tool}."
2. Casper reviews: is this tool appropriate? Does it overlap with another trader?
3. If approved: tool added to trader's skill manifest in agents repo
4. Tool usage tracked per trade: did using this tool improve outcomes?
5. If unused for 30 days: tool revoked

This creates natural divergence without artificial constraints. Traders converge on strategy but diverge on tool access based on what they prove works.

### 7.1 Signal Board

Traders publish observations to `/signals` endpoint each tick. Other traders read it.

```json
{
  "trader": "kairos",
  "type": "observation | lesson | alert",
  "ticker": "AAPL",
  "observation": "Momentum breakout above 0.8 confirmed by volume spike",
  "regime": "TRENDING_UP",
  "confidence": 0.72
}
```

### 7.2 Cross-Trader Learning

- **Divergence detection**: If all three traders have negative alpha simultaneously, probable regime shift → escalate.
- **Correlation check**: If two traders hold the same ticker, flag for herding risk.
- **Shared lessons**: Successful trade patterns are published and injected into other traders' context.

---

## §8 — Drawdown Management

### 8.1 Circuit Breaker

| Drawdown | Action |
|----------|--------|
| < 5% | Normal trading |
| 5–10% | Position sizes reduced by 50% |
| 10–15% | Trading paused. Learning loop only (observe, don't act). |
| > 15% | Emergency stop. Trader disabled. Human must re-enable. |

### 8.2 Cooling-Off

After 3 consecutive losing trades: skip the next 2 signals. Journal: "Cooling off after 3 consecutive losses. Reviewing what went wrong."

### 8.3 Recovery Mode

When trading is paused: the trader enters observation-only mode. It still processes ticks, makes mock decisions, and journals — but orders are not sent. It exits recovery when it can articulate a coherent reason for the drawdown and a plan to address it.

---

## §9 — Cold Start

### 9.1 Warm-Up Period

First 10 trading days per trader:

- Position sizes: 50% of normal
- Stop losses: 1.5x wider (more room to learn)
- No parameter tuning (insufficient data)
- No prompt evolution (insufficient data)
- All trades tagged `mode: warmup`

Minimum thresholds before full operation:
- 20 closed trades OR 30 trading days
- Positive expectancy in warm-up

### 9.2 Default Parameters

Each trader ships with conservative defaults backtested against 2 years of historical data (not optimized — just "reasonable"). These defaults are in the agents repo and serve as the fallback if optimization ever goes wrong.

---

## §10 — Performance Tracking

### 10.1 Daily Snapshots

Every night, write to `performance_history` table on TrueNAS:

```
trader_id, date, equity, cash, pnl, calmar_30d, calmar_90d,
sharpe_30d, profit_factor, win_rate, max_drawdown,
trades_closed, trades_won, avg_hold_hours, regime_distribution
```

### 10.2 Rolling Leaderboard

```
Leaderboard (30-day rolling):
1. Kairos:  Calmar 2.1, PF 1.8, MaxDD -4.2%  ▲ +0.3 from last week
2. Stonks:  Calmar 1.6, PF 1.4, MaxDD -7.1%  ▼ -0.1 from last week
3. Aldridge: Calmar 1.1, PF 1.2, MaxDD -9.8%  — no change
           SPY B&H: Calmar 0.9
```

### 10.3 Improvement Score

"Is the system getting better over time?"

```
improvement_score = (current_30d_calmar - calmar_30d_60_days_ago) / abs(calmar_30d_60_days_ago)

Positive → improving. Negative → getting worse. Zero → flat.
```

---

## §11 — A/B Testing (Shadow Mode)

### 11.1 Shadow Execution

When a learning loop PR is opened with proposed parameter changes:

1. **Shadow mode**: The new config runs alongside the live config for 5 trading days
2. Shadow trader makes decisions, logs them, but orders are NOT sent
3. After 5 days: compare shadow vs live P&L

### 11.2 Auto-Merge Criteria

```
if shadow_calmar > live_calmar + 0.2 AND shadow_max_drawdown <= live_max_drawdown:
    AUTO-MERGE with label "shadow-validated"
else:
    FLAG for human review with label "needs-review"
```

### 11.3 Rollback

Every accepted PR creates a rollback point. If live performance degrades > 10% within 10 days of merge, auto-revert and journal why.

---

## §12 — Change Velocity Control

### 12.1 Change Budget

Per trader, per month: maximum 5 parameter changes. The optimizer must choose which changes matter most.

### 12.2 Change Damping

Parameter changes are smoothed: `new_value = 0.7 × old_value + 0.3 × proposed_value`

Prevents whipsaw. A parameter that oscillates weekly isn't converging.

### 12.3 Revert Detection

If a parameter is changed and then reverted within 20 days, the change budget for that parameter is halved next month. The optimizer is learning to be wrong — it needs to slow down.

## §13 — Prompt Evolution Pipeline

### 13.1 Git-Based Prompt Versioning

Prompts live in the agents repo (`casper-bot-wodinga/paper-trading-agents`). Every version is a git commit. Branching is how we experiment; merging is how we promote.

```
agents/
  traders/
    kairos/prompt.md       ← the actual prompt file (git-tracked)
    aldridge/prompt.md
    stonks/prompt.md
```

**Branch structure:**

```
main                        ← production prompt. What traders use in live ticks.
│
├── kairos/v1.0.0           ← tagged stable releases (git tag, immutable)
├── kairos/v1.0.1
├── aldridge/v1.0.0
├── stonks/v1.0.0
│
sweep/YYYY-MM-DD/           ← nightly auto-generated branches
├── kairos/variant-001      ← "paraphrased strategy, Calmar +0.3 on replay"
├── kairos/variant-047      ← "risk emphasis = high, Sortino +0.5"
├── kairos/variant-089      ← "reordered instructions, Calmar -0.1"
└── ... (100 total per night)
│
experiment/{trader}/         ← manual or agent-proposed experiments
├── kairos/more-momentum
├── aldridge/value-only
└── stonks/sentiment-heavy
```

**Winner promotion flow:**

```
Night: sweep runs 100 variants on Docker workers
  → variant-047 scores +5.2% Calmar vs baseline on replay
  → auto-PR: sweep/2026-07-05/kairos/variant-047 → main
  → CI runs: replay validation, statistical significance check
  → Hermes + Casper review
  → Squash-merged to main
  → Tagged: kairos/v1.0.3
  → Trader picks up new prompt on next tick
```

**Pruning rules (runs nightly via cron):**

| Branch pattern | Delete after | Condition |
|---|---|---|
| `sweep/*` | 7 days | Always — sweep branches are disposable |
| `experiment/*` | 14 days | If no PR opened and no commits in 7 days |
| Tags | Never | Immutable release history |

```bash
# Nightly cleanup cron
git fetch --prune
git branch -r | grep 'sweep/' | while read b; do
  git push origin --delete "${b#origin/}"
done
```

Losing variants are the point — 99 of 100 branches die every night, but the 1 that survived made the trader better. The repo stays clean because dead branches auto-prune.

Automated analysis:
1. Group trades by prompt version active at the time
2. Compare performance: "v1.0.2 had Sharpe 0.3 higher than v1.0.1"
3. Analyze prompt instructions: which instructions correlate with wins vs losses?
4. Propose specific prompt edits: "Replace 'prioritize momentum' with 'prioritize momentum but check RSI first'"

### 13.3 Prompt Sweep Infrastructure

```python
# Runs nightly on Docker workers
def generate_variants(base_prompt: str, n: int = 100) -> list[PromptVariant]:
    """Generate N prompt variants using:
    - Paraphrasing (reword strategy description)
    - Emphasis shifts (risk-focused, opportunity-focused, balanced)
    - Instruction ordering (does order of rules matter?)
    - Example injection (add winning trade as example)
    """
```

---

## §14 — Counterfactual Analysis

### 14.1 Hold-Longer Analysis

For every closed winning trade: simulate holding +1, +3, +5, +10 more days. Report:
- "Held AAPL 2 days for +3.2%. Counterfactual: holding 5 days = +8.7% (+5.5% opportunity cost)"
- If opportunity cost > 50% of realized gain, flag for hold period review

### 14.2 Missed Entry Analysis

For tickers on the trader's watchlist that weren't traded: "Would buying have been profitable?"
- If yes: trader was too conservative. Propose reducing conviction threshold.
- If no: trader correctly avoided a bad trade. Reinforce current behavior.

### 14.3 Stop-Loss Optimization

Simulate tighter/wider stops on past trades. Find optimal stop distance that maximizes P&L while keeping drawdown below threshold.

---

## §15 — Corporate Actions & Data Integrity

### 15.1 Detection

Check Alpaca corporate actions API daily. Flag: splits, dividends, mergers, delistings, trading halts.

### 15.2 Adjustment

- All prices served by data bus are split-adjusted
- Dividend dates: adjust position cost basis, don't treat as P&L
- Delisted ticker: liquidate position, exclude from history
- Trading halt: skip ticker for that heartbeat

### 15.3 Learning Data Integrity

Trades affected by corporate actions are excluded from the learning loop's optimization dataset. Tagged in DB as `exclude_reason: corporate_action`.

---

## §16 — Distributed Compute Architecture

### 16.1 Data Lake (TrueNAS .96)

```
/mnt/truenas/trading/
  market_data/
    bars/           ← 1-min OHLCV per ticker, back to 2015
    quotes/         ← bid/ask
    fundamentals/   ← earnings, splits, dividends
  trader_data/
    trades.db       ← every trade, every trader
    equity_curves/  ← daily snapshots
    performance/    ← rolling metrics
  replay_cache/     ← preprocessed data for fast replay
```

### 16.2 Docker Workers (.179)

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  replay-worker:
    image: paper-trading-replay
    deploy:
      replicas: 20
    volumes:
      - truenas_mount:/data
    command: python worker.py --mode replay --config $CONFIG_HASH
    resources:
      limits:
        cpus: '1'
        memory: 512M
```

20 parallel workers, each replays one variant. Results aggregated by the orchestrator.

### 16.3 Ollama Workers (Mac .237)

For prompt sweep variants that can use cheaper local inference instead of API calls. Reduces costs by ~60% for sweep runs.

### 16.4 Orchestration

Hermes (.131) controls the nightly pipeline:
1. Dispatch sweep to Docker + Ollama
2. Collect results from TrueNAS
3. Rank by objective score
4. Generate PR if improvement found
5. Update dashboard

---

## §17 — Nightly Pipeline

```
20:00 ET — Market data final. Begin pipeline.

Step 1: Regime Detection
  Compute regime for each tick of the day

Step 2: Trade Settlement
  Confirm all fills, reconcile P&L, update trade DB

Step 3: Performance Snapshots
  Compute daily metrics, write to performance_history

Step 4: Counterfactual Analysis
  Run hold-longer, missed-entry, stop-loss optimization

Step 5: Parameter Optimization (Gradient)
  Run finite-diff gradient on day's data
  Propose changes that pass validation

Step 6: Prompt Sweep (Parallel)
  Generate 100 variants, fan out to Docker/Ollama
  Replay day's data with each variant
  Rank by objective score

Step 7: Auto-PR
  If parameter change OR prompt variant improves objective:
    Create PR with before/after metrics, validation results
  If no improvement:
    Journal "no changes proposed"

Step 8: Knowledge Sharing
  Publish trader observations to shared signal board
  Cross-trader analysis: divergences, herding, regime shifts

Step 9: Dashboard Update
  Push updated leaderboard, equity curves, regime map

Step 10: Agent Journal
  Each trader writes nightly reflection:
    "What I learned today. What I'd do differently. What I'm watching tomorrow."
```

## §18 — Auto-Heal (Enhanced)

### 18.1 Monitors (All `no_agent: true` crons)

| Monitor | Frequency | What it checks |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| `drawdown_monitor` | 15 min | Any trader > 10% DD → alert. > 15% → pause. |
| `stale_trader` | 30 min | Any trader with 0 trades in 2 days → nudge |
| `data_freshness` | 15 min | Alpaca data age < 5 min |

| `optimization_health` | Daily | Last N parameter changes: did they improve live P&L? If no, slow learning rate. |
| `cost_monitor` | 1 hour | API spend vs budget. Alert at 80%. |

### 18.2 Escalation Protocol

| Severity | Channel | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| P3 (info) | Log only | "Regime transitioned to MEAN_REVERTING" |
| P2 (warning) | Canvas | "Aldridge drawdown at 8%, reducing position sizes" |
| P1 (critical) | Canvas + Telegram DM | "Kairos drawdown > 15%, PAUSED" |
| P0 (emergency) | Canvas + Telegram + pause all trading | "Data bus down. No market data available." |

- Then: Kairos's observation appears in Aldridge's context

---

## §21 — Resolved Design Decisions

### 21.1 Gradient Step Size — Aggressive

Start at **0.03 per tick** (3× original proposal). Rationale: 5 months in and traders haven't delivered. A momentum threshold at 0.55 with ±0.03 per tick moves across the full range [0.3, 0.9] in ~20 ticks (about 1 week). Fast enough to matter, bounded enough to not destroy.

Still constrained by:
- Max parameter change per tick: 8% of range
- Minimum 3 ticks between changes to same parameter
- All changes logged with before/after scores

This is itself a meta-parameter: `gradient.learning_rate` in config, tunable over time.

### 21.2 Prompt Sweep Variant Count

**100 variants per night**, scaling to 200 if Mac Ollama throughput allows. Each replay uses yesterday's data (see §21.5). Cost ceiling: $0.25/night for API inference, $0 for Ollama workers.

### 21.3 Auto-Merge Thresholds — Tiered

All thresholds are tunable parameters in `learning_loop.auto_merge` config:

| Calmar Improvement | Action |
|---|---|
| > 10% | Auto-merge, no human needed |
| 5–10% | Auto-merge with notification to Telegram |
| 1–5% | PR created, labeled `needs-review` |
| < 1% | No PR (below noise floor) |

### 21.4 Trader Strategy — Converge Allowed, Tools Diverge

Traders are allowed to converge on similar strategies. Correlation is monitored but not prevented.

**Tool-based divergence**: Each trader starts with different tool access and can request new tools through the learning loop. A trader that's succeeding with a specific tool keeps it. A trader that wants to experiment requests access.

```
Trader skill profiles (initial):
  Kairos:   momentum tools, RSI, MACD
  Aldridge: value tools, P/E screening, dividend analysis
  Stonks:   sentiment tools, news scraping, social media signals

Learning loop addition:
  - Trader can propose: "I want access to {tool}"
  - Proposal includes: why it helps, expected impact
  - Casper reviews and approves/denies
  - Approved tools added to trader's skill manifest
  - Tool usage tracked per trade for effectiveness scoring
```

This means the skill system is part of the learning loop. A trader that never uses a tool loses it. A trader that proves a tool's value keeps it and shares the evidence.

### 21.5 Replay Harness — Always Default to Yesterday

The replay harness always replays the most recent complete trading day by default. No guessing date ranges.

```bash
# Default: replay yesterday
python replay.py --trader kairos

# Go back N days
python replay.py --trader kairos --days-back 5

# Specific date range (rare, for debugging)
python replay.py --trader kairos --from 2026-06-15 --to 2026-06-20
```

Data storage on TrueNAS is organized by date: `market_data/bars/YYYY/MM/DD/`. The replay harness reads the requested day(s), builds the market state, and feeds it to the trader. This makes the nightly sweep dead simple: always replay yesterday, always.

### 21.6 Timeframe

Daily bars for the signal engine. 5-min bars provided to the LLM trader as supplementary intraday context. Gradient descent operates on daily-level parameters only. Add intraday parameters (entry/exit timing within the day) as a future phase once daily-level system is stable.

---

## §22 — Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning)

### 22.1 Why RL for Trading

The gradient descent approach (§3) treats parameter tuning as a continuous optimization problem. But trading is fundamentally a **sequential decision problem under uncertainty**: an agent observes a state (market data, portfolio), takes an action (BUY/SELL/HOLD), receives a reward (P&L), and transitions to a new state. This maps exactly to the RL framework.

Q-Learning learns a policy: given a market state, what action maximizes expected future reward? This is more principled than perturbing parameters and checking if P&L improved — it directly models the decision process.

### 22.2 How Q-Learning Replaces/Supplements Gradient Descent

```
State space (discretized):
  - Regime: TRENDING_UP | TRENDING_DOWN | MEAN_REVERTING | HIGH_VOL
  - Momentum signal: LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH
  - RSI zone: OVERSOLD | NEUTRAL | OVERBOUGHT
  - Portfolio exposure: 0-20% | 20-40% | 40-60% | 60-80% | 80-100%
  - Current drawdown: <5% | 5-10% | >10%

Action space:
  - BUY (with conviction: 0.25 | 0.50 | 0.75 | 1.0)
  - SELL
  - HOLD

Reward:
  - +1 for profitable closed trade
  - -1 for losing closed trade
  - -0.1 per tick for holding (encourages action)
  - -5 for drawdown > 10% (catastrophic penalty)
```

### 22.3 Q-Table Update

```
Q(s, a) ← Q(s, a) + α [r + γ · max_a' Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)]

α = learning rate (0.1, decays over time)
γ = discount factor (0.95 — value future rewards highly)
```

The Q-table is persisted to disk after every update. On startup, the trader loads its Q-table. Over weeks of trading, the table converges to an optimal policy.

### 22.4 Dual-Learner Architecture

The system runs **both** gradient descent (§3) and Q-Learning (§22) simultaneously:

```
Tick processing:
  1. Signal engine produces structured signals (gradient-tuned params)
  2. Q-Learning agent proposes action based on state
  3. LLM trader reviews both and makes final decision
  4. After trade closes: Q-table updated with reward
  5. Nightly: gradient runs on signal params, Q-table evaluation runs on replay

Conflict resolution:
  If gradient says BUY and Q-Learning says HOLD:
    → LLM trader adjudicates, journaling which signal it followed
    → Both learners get the outcome data
    → Over time, the better learner's decisions correlate with better outcomes
```

### 22.5 Q-Learning vs Gradient Descent

| Aspect | Gradient Descent (§3) | Q-Learning (§22) |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|
| What it tunes | Continuous signal params | Discrete action policy |
| Update speed | Per tick (small adjustments) | Per closed trade (sparse but meaningful) |
| Cold start | Needs 20+ trades to be useful | Needs 100+ state visits per action |
| Overfitting risk | High (needs walk-forward validation) | Moderate (discretization provides regularization) |
| Interpretability | Easy (threshold = 0.55) | Hard (Q-values are opaque) |
| Computation | Cheap (perturb + replay) | Cheap (table lookup + update) |

Both run in parallel. The objective function (§2) evaluates which approach is driving better outcomes and weights decisions accordingly.

---

## §23 — Enhanced Risk Metrics

### 23.1 Sortino Ratio

The Sortino ratio is like Sharpe but only penalizes **downside** volatility. For trading, upside volatility is profit — we shouldn't penalize it.

```
Sortino = (R_p - R_f) / σ_d

R_p = portfolio return
R_f = risk-free rate (T-bill yield, ~4%)
σ_d = downside deviation (stddev of negative returns only)
```

A Sortino > 2.0 is excellent. Added to the objective function (§2.2) at weight 0.15.

### 23.2 Value at Risk (VaR)

VaR answers: "What's the worst-case loss with 95% confidence over the next day?"

```
VaR_95 = μ - 1.645 × σ

μ = mean daily return
σ = stddev daily return
1.645 = z-score for 95% confidence
```

Example: VaR_95 = -$150 means "we're 95% confident we won't lose more than $150 tomorrow."

Used in the risk system (§5) as an additional gate: if VaR_95 exceeds 5% of portfolio, reduce position sizes.

### 23.3 Risk Budget

Each trader gets a risk budget: max 5% VaR per position, max 15% VaR across portfolio. The drawdown circuit breaker (§8) already covers catastrophic scenarios; VaR covers the normal-case worst day.

---

## §24 — Unsupervised Regime Detection

### 24.1 K-Means Clustering for Market States

The rule-based regime detector (§5) uses simple thresholds (ADX > 25, VIX > 25). This works but is rigid. K-Means clustering discovers natural market states from data:

```
Features per day:
  - SPY daily return
  - SPY 20-day rolling volatility
  - VIX level
  - Advance-decline ratio (NYSE)
  - Sector correlation (avg pairwise corr of 11 sector ETFs)
  - Volume relative to 20-day avg

K = 4 clusters (matching our 4 regimes, but discovered from data)

Nightly: recluster last 90 days of data
Label clusters: which one performed best for momentum? For value?
```

### 24.2 PCA for Dimensionality Reduction

The raw market data has hundreds of correlated features. PCA reduces to 3-5 principal components:

```
PC1: "risk-on/risk-off" axis (explains ~40% variance)
PC2: "momentum/value" axis (explains ~20% variance)
PC3: "volatility regime" axis (explains ~15% variance)
```

The LLM trader's context includes: "PC1 is at +1.2σ (risk-on), PC2 at -0.8σ (value over momentum)."

### 24.3 Dual Regime Pipeline

Both the rule-based (§5) and unsupervised (§24) regime detectors run in parallel. The objective function evaluates which produces better regime-tagged performance. Over time, the system may shift weight toward the better detector or ensemble them.

---

## §25 — Verification Scenarios (Additions)

### RL-001: Q-Table Persistence
- Given: trader with 50 state visits and learned Q-values
- When: trader process restarts
- Then: Q-table loads from disk with all 50 entries intact

### RL-002: Q-Learning Convergence
- Given: static market environment (replay mode)
- When: 500 episodes of Q-Learning
- Then: Q-values stabilize (max delta < 0.01 for 10 episodes)

### SORTINO-001: Downside-Only Calculation
- Given: returns = [+2%, +3%, -1%, +4%, -5%]
- When: compute_sortino() is called
- Then: only [-1%, -5%] contribute to downside deviation
- And: [+2%, +3%, +4%] are excluded

### VAR-001: Confidence Calculation
- Given: daily returns with μ = 0.1%, σ = 1.5%
- When: compute_var_95() is called
- Then: VaR_95 ≈ -2.37% (μ - 1.645 × σ)

### KMEANS-001: Cluster Discovery
- Given: 90 days of market features
- When: K-Means with K=4 is run
- Then: 4 distinct clusters found
- And: each day assigned to exactly one cluster

---

## §26 — Agent File Architecture

How OpenClaw agents structure their knowledge. This is what the simulation engine simulates.

### 26.1 File Types and Purposes

| File | Where | Purpose | Changing Frequency |
|------|-------|---------|-------------------|
| `AGENTS.md` | `agent/AGENTS.md` | Operating manual: what the agent owns, its principles, escalation rules, how it operates | Occasionally (learns a better workflow) |
| `SOUL.md` | `agent/SOUL.md` | Personality and voice: how the agent thinks, speaks, and journals | Rarely (identity is stable) |
| `IDENTITY.md` | `agent/IDENTITY.md` | Metadata: name, emoji, creature type, vibe | Almost never |
| `TOOLS.md` | `agent/TOOLS.md` | Local notes: SSH hosts, API endpoints, device nicknames — environment-specific | When infrastructure changes |
| `MEMORY.md` | `agent/MEMORY.md` | Persistent learnings: what went well yesterday, news to watch, market observations | Daily (written during nightly reflection) |
| `SKILL.md` | `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Tool procedures: how to use Alpaca API, how to compute RSI, how to execute a trade. Reusable across agents. | When a better procedure is discovered |

### 26.2 Skill vs Agent File

**Skills are SHARED procedures.** `skill-alpaca-kairos` teaches Kairos how to use the Alpaca API. Multiple agents can load the same skill. Skills say "here's how you do X."

**Agent files are PERSONAL context.** AGENTS.md says "you are Kairos, you trade momentum." SOUL.md says "you're confident, aggressive, journal in first person." They differ per agent.

### 26.3 Prompt Assembly Order

When an OpenClaw agent receives a tick, its prompt is assembled as:

```
[IDENTITY.md]        → "I am Kairos. I trade momentum."
[AGENTS.md]          → "My job: read signals, decide BUY/SELL/HOLD, journal."
[SOUL.md]            → "I'm confident. I stick to what's proven."
[SKILL.md files]     → "Here's how to use Alpaca. Here's how to compute signal strength."
[TOOLS.md]           → "Alpaca endpoint: https://paper-api.alpaca.markets. My key is in ENV."
[MEMORY.md]          → "Yesterday AAPL broke out. Watching for follow-through."
[JOURNAL entries]    → Last 10 tick decisions and rationales
[TICK DATA]          → Current price, RSI, momentum, regime, portfolio state
```

### 26.4 Prompt Size Constraint

OpenClaw limits prompt size. Smaller is always better. The simulation must respect this:

- **Target:** Under 3,000 tokens for the full assembled prompt
- **Strategy:** Push technical detail into skills (loaded on demand, not always in context). Keep AGENTS.md and SOUL.md tight.
- **Journal:** Cap at last 10 entries. Trim rationales to one sentence.
- **Skills:** Reference by name with 1-line summary, not full procedure text.

### 26.5 What Gets Tweaked Overnight

| File | Tweaked? | How |
|------|----------|-----|
| AGENTS.md | Yes | Rule changes: "buy when momentum > 0.6" → "buy when momentum > 0.5 AND RSI < 70" |
| SOUL.md | Rarely | Shift emphasis: "be aggressive" → "be patient" |
| TOOLS.md | No | Updated only when infrastructure changes |
| MEMORY.md | Read-only | Read during simulation, not written back |
| SKILL.md | Yes | Procedure improvements: "use limit orders not market orders" |
| IDENTITY.md | No | Never changes |

---

## §27 — Simulation & Learning Engine

The overnight training system. Runs hundreds of prompt × parameter × regime scenarios on
a growing window of historical data. The system proposes its own hypotheses, tests them, and
promotes what works — the trader agents learn without daily human tweaking.

### 27.1 Scale

**Hundreds of scenarios every night.** Not 20 conservative variants. The full matrix:

```
3 traders
  × 5-10 prompt variants (AGENTS.md tweaks)
  × 3-5 param configurations (signal engine thresholds)
  × 4 regime contexts (TRENDING_UP, TRENDING_DOWN, MEAN_REVERTING, HIGH_VOL)
  × growing data window (5 days fast, 30 days deep, 90 days weekend)
```

| Pipeline | Scenarios | Data Window | Model | Cost Est. |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-------|-----------|
| **Fast screen** (nightly) | ~150-300 | 5 days | v4-flash | ~$0.10 |
| **Deep validation** (nightly, top candidates) | ~15-25 | 30 days | v4-flash | ~$0.08 |
| **Weekend sweep** (top performers) | ~5-10 | 90 days | v4-pro + flash | ~$0.15 |
| **Total weekly** | ~1,200 scenarios | | | ~$1.50 |

### 27.2 What Gets Tested

Each scenario varies:

**Prompt axis** (changes to AGENTS.md and SKILL.md):
- Decision rules: "buy when momentum > 0.6" → different thresholds, added conditions
- Tool usage: "use limit orders" vs "use market orders", "check sector first" vs "check volume first"
- Risk posture: "aggressive" vs "defensive" framing in SOUL.md
- Journal style: detailed vs terse rationales (affects context window utilization)
- Skill references: which skills are loaded in which order

**Parameter axis** (signal engine numbers):
- `momentum_threshold`, `rsi_oversold`, `base_size_pct`, `stop_loss_pct`
- `conviction_multiplier`, `max_positions`, regime weights
- Bounded, continuous, safe ranges only

**Regime axis** (market context filter):
- Run scenarios tagged by regime to discover: "does this prompt+param combo work in ALL regimes or only TRENDING_UP?"
- If a combo excels in one regime but tanks in another → regime-scoped config

### 27.3 Autonomous Hypothesis Generation

The system doesn't just test human-proposed variants. It proposes its own:

```
Nightly analysis:
  1. Load last night's results (all scenarios, all scores)
  2. Group by: trader, regime, prompt variant, param config
  3. Find patterns:
     - "Kairos scores +0.15 better when momentum_threshold > 0.55 in TRENDING_UP"
     - "Aldridge's 'check sector ETF' prompt scores -0.08 vs baseline — hurts value strategy"
     - "Stonks Calmar drops when position_size > 0.15 in HIGH_VOL"
  4. Generate hypotheses:
     - "If momentum_threshold=0.65 AND 'check volume first', Kairos might do better"
     - "If we remove 'sector check' for Aldridge but add 'PE < industry avg'..."
  5. Queue hypotheses as new scenarios for next night
```

This means the active variant list grows organically. Winners persist, losers drop out,
new ideas generated from patterns. Human review optional but not required.

### 27.4 Growing Data Window

The simulation window expands as days pass:

```
Day 1:   replay yesterday (5 scenarios/day → 5 total ticks)
Day 7:   replay last 5 days (25 ticks)
Day 14:  replay last 10 days (50 ticks)
Day 30:  replay last 20 days (100 ticks)
Day 90:  replay last 60 days (300 ticks) — weekend deep sweep
```

Each night, the growing window means more statistical confidence. A variant that
scores well on 5 days might regress on 30. The system learns this and adapts.

### 27.5 Trader Strategy Optimization

Each trader's AGENTS.md encodes their strategy. The simulation optimizes within
that strategy, not against it:

| Trader | Strategy | What Gets Optimized |
|--------|----------|--------------------|
| **Kairos** (momentum) | Buy strength, ride trends | Momentum thresholds, trend confirmation rules, conviction scaling |
| **Aldridge** (value) | Buy undervalued, wait | Value signal weights, patience rules, multi-position sizing |
| **Stonks** (sentiment) | Follow narrative, act fast | Sentiment thresholds, entry/exit speed, meme filtering |

The system never says "Kairos should trade value." It says "Kairos's momentum
works best with these thresholds in this regime."

### 27.6 Tool Proficiency Learning

Traders have tools (skills). The simulation discovers which tools produce edge:

```
For each trader:
  For each skill they have access to:
    Run scenarios WITH the skill loaded vs WITHOUT
    Measure: does having this skill improve Calmar?

  Result:
    skill-alpaca-kairos:   +0.12 Calmar (essential)
    stock-analysis:         +0.08 Calmar (useful)
    sell-the-news:          -0.03 Calmar (maybe harmful — over-cautious on good news?)
    self-improvement:       +0.01 Calmar (marginal)

  → System proposes: drop sell-the-news, keep others
  → If sustained for 5+ nights: auto-remove skill from config
```

### 27.7 Journal as Learning Signal

The journal isn't just context for the next tick — it's training data:

```
After a simulation run, analyze the journal:
  - Which decisions had high conviction but lost? (overconfidence)
  - Which had low conviction but won? (underconfidence — missed sizing)
  - Do journal entries become more accurate over the day? (learning)
  - Does the agent contradict itself? ("buying AAPL" at 10am, "AAPL overvalued" at 2pm)

This analysis feeds back into AGENTS.md:
  "You tend to be overconfident early in the day. Consider smaller first positions."
```

### 27.8 Weekly Summary & Auto-Promotion

Every Monday morning, the system produces a summary of the past week's learning:

```
Week of July 5-11:

Kairos — 1,247 scenarios tested
  Best combo: momentum_threshold=0.62 + "check volume first" + limit orders
  Calmar improvement: +0.18 over baseline (sustained 5 nights)
  → AUTO-PROMOTED to main. New version: kairos/v1.2.0

Aldridge — 1,103 scenarios tested
  Best combo: PE_gate=15 + "wait for pullback" + 5 max positions
  Calmar improvement: +0.09 over baseline (sustained 3 nights)
  → PR opened, labeled needs-review

Stonks — 980 scenarios tested
  Best combo: sentiment_threshold=0.7 + "ignore meme stocks"
  Calmar improvement: +0.04 (2 nights, volatile)
  → Kept in active list, needs more validation
```

### 27.9 Implementation

CLI:
```bash
python3 -m src.simulator sweep --all              # nightly: all traders, fast screen
python3 -m src.simulator sweep --trader kairos    # single trader
python3 -m src.simulator deep --trader kairos     # top candidates, 30-day data
python3 -m src.simulator weekend                  # 90-day deep sweep, all traders
python3 -m src.simulator analyze --trader kairos  # generate hypotheses from results
python3 -m src.simulator promote --trader kairos  # auto-promote if thresholds met
```

Architecture:
```
src/simulator.py          ← main simulation loop + CLI
src/hypothesis.py         ← pattern analysis + variant generation
src/prompt_builder.py     ← assemble full prompt from agent files + journal + tick
src/llm_engine.py         ← OpenRouter API calls, response parsing
config/sweep.yaml         ← scenario matrix config, cost limits, schedule
```

## §28 — Database Migration System

### 28.1 Why

The trading schema evolves. Parameters get added, tables get columns, indices change.
Manual `schema.sql` files drift from what's actually running. We need versioned,
repeatable, automated migrations — like Liquibase but lightweight.

### 28.2 Design

Simple migration system: numbered SQL files, applied in order, tracked in a
`schema_migrations` table.

```
src/db/migrations/
  001_initial_schema.sql      ← what's running now
  002_add_news_sentiment.sql  ← future: add sentiment column to news
  003_add_indexes.sql         ← future: perf indexes
```

Each migration file has an `UP` section (apply) and optional `DOWN` section (rollback).
A `migrate` CLI command applies any unapplied migrations.

### 28.3 Implementation (backlog — Phase 2)

```
python3 -m src.db.migrate status    # show applied + pending
python3 -m src.db.migrate up        # apply pending
python3 -m src.db.migrate down 1    # rollback last migration
python3 -m src.db.migrate create    # scaffold new migration file
```

Migration tracking table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS schema_migrations (
    version INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    applied_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    checksum TEXT
);
```

### 28.4 Priority

Not urgent — current schema is stable for Phase 1. Add before Phase 2 (distributed
workers, multi-machine schema sync). Tracked in GitHub Issues as `backlog/db-migrations`.

## §29 — Signal Threshold Tuning & Sweep Optimization

**Status:** Active — implemented based on sweep testing results showing 0 trades
across all scenarios. The signal engine correctly identifies regimes but produces
composite signals too weak to trigger trading decisions.

### 29.1 Root Cause

The `momentum_threshold` at 0.55 acts as a divisor in the momentum score
computation (`scaled = score / threshold`). At 0.55, a 1% price move becomes
a momentum score of ~0.018, which when blended with RSI and regime components
produces composite signals peaking around ±0.22 — far below the conviction
thresholds that trigger BUY/SELL decisions.

### 29.2 Solution: Relaxed Threshold Presets

Instead of a single conservative default, the signal engine now supports
multiple preset configurations:

```yaml
# Presets in SignalParams
conservative:  # Original defaults — production, vetted against 2y data
  momentum_threshold: 0.55
  rsi_oversold: 30
  rsi_overbought: 70

relaxed:       # Sweep starting point — lower bar to get trades flowing
  momentum_threshold: 0.25    # [0.10, 0.35] sweep range
  rsi_oversold: 35            # [25, 45]
  rsi_overbought: 65          # [55, 75]
  vol_regime_threshold: 0.20  # [0.10, 0.40]
  base_size_pct: 0.12         # smaller positions = more safety

aggressive:    # Max sensitivity — for finding the edge
  momentum_threshold: 0.15
  rsi_oversold: 40
  rsi_overbought: 60
  vol_reduction_multiplier: 0.5
```

### 29.3 Pre-Warm Mechanism

Each `run_scenario` creates a fresh `SignalEngine()`, which needs 20+ ticks
before indicators (momentum, RSI, volatility) produce meaningful values.
The first 20 ticks of every scenario are effectively dead air.

**Fix:** Before the scoring loop, feed 30 initial ticks to the signal engine
to establish a baseline price history. Only start counting trades from tick 31.

```
for tick in market_data[:30]:   # pre-warm (silent)
    signal_engine.process(tick)

for tick in market_data[30:]:   # scoring loop
    ...
```

### 29.4 Three-Phase Night Pipeline

Replace the current two-phase (backfill → sweep loop) with three phases:

| Phase | What | Duration |
|-------|------|----------|
| **1. Backfill** | yfinance → Postgres, all tickers, 30 days | ~5 min |
| **2. Sweep (relaxed)** | All traders × relaxed thresholds × variants | ~60 min |
| **3. Auto-relax & re-sweep** | Detect 0-trade runs, lower thresholds, re-run | ~120 min |

**Phase 3 auto-relax logic:**

```
for each trader:
    if max_trades_across_all_scenarios == 0:
        for param in [momentum_threshold, rsi_oversold, rsi_overbought]:
            relax by 20% of range (toward more permissive)
        re-run sweep with relaxed params
    elif max_trades < 3:
        relax by 10% of range
        re-run sweep
    else:
        record results, move on
```

Max 3 relaxation iterations per night per trader to avoid runaway.

### 29.5 Learning Loop Feedback Target

`objective_score` penalizes no-trade runs at -1.5. After each sweep iteration,
the hypothesis engine should:

1. **Lower thresholds** on traders scoring -1.5 (no trades) — the signal bar is too high
2. **Raise thresholds** on traders with >20 trades and negative PnL — overtrading
3. **Fine-tune** traders with 3-20 trades and positive PnL — sweet spot

This creates a self-correcting feedback loop: thresholds automatically converge
to the level where trades actually happen, then optimize for quality.

### 29.6 Implementation

All of the above are implemented in:
- `src/signals.py` — `SignalParams.relaxed_sweep()` and `aggressive()` factory methods
- `src/simulator.py` — Pre-warm in `run_scenario`, auto-relax in `run_sweep`
- `scripts/night_pipeline_v2.py` — Three-phase pipeline with auto-relax loop

## §30 — Operational Hygiene (learned Jul 6, 2026)

Lessons from the first bootstrap attempt where zero trades executed across 10+ days.

### 30.1 Prompt Deployment Path

The traders run inside OpenClaw workspaces. They have two execution modes:

| Mode | Trigger | What it does | Reads |
|------|---------|-------------|-------|
| **Trading cron** | OpenClaw agent cron (every 5-15 min during market) | Makes BUY/SELL/HOLD decision | AGENTS.md (output format) + SKILL.md (strategy) + cron inline prompt |
| **HEARTBEAT** | Separate cron (less frequent) | Reviews trades, tunes params, commits, reflection | HEARTBEAT.md (review/improve instructions) |

**HEARTBEAT.md is NOT for trading decisions.** It handles post-trade reflection and parameter tuning. Confusing the two leads to agents that think their job is maintenance instead of trading.

The prompt deployment path is:
```
paper-trading-prompts/kairos/prompt.txt  (source of truth)
    → openclaw@.41:~/.openclaw/workspace-trader-kairos/AGENTS.md (output format + workflow)
    → openclaw@.41:~/.openclaw/workspace-trader-kairos/skills/persona-strategy/SKILL.md (strategy)
```

**Invariant:** After any prompt change, verify the workspace files match. A beautiful prompt in git that the trader never reads is dead code.

### 30.2 Cron Hygiene

Cron jobs that trigger trader ticks have two layers:
1. The cron schedule and timeout
2. An optional inline prompt that overrides the system prompt

**Rules:**
- **Inline prompts MUST preserve format rules.** "TRADE MORE. LOOSER." without "thesis 20+ chars, signals_used mandatory" causes risk veto cascades.
- **Inline prompts should be minimal.** Preferred: "Follow your system prompt (AGENTS.md). Remember: thesis 20+ chars, signals_used mandatory."
- **No duplicate crons per trader.** One cron firing at overlapping times with another = double-inference, conflicting prompts, or broken delivery.
- **Cron timeout ≥ model P99 × 3.** A reasoning model at 120s/call with a 180s timeout = guaranteed timeout. Flash models can use 300s; pro models need 600s.

### 30.3 Intraday Monitoring Split

Hermes and Casper split intraday monitoring to avoid gaps:

| Slot | Owner | Schedule |
|------|-------|----------|
| 9:30, 11:30, 1:30, 3:30 ET | Hermes | Odd hours |
| 10:00, 12:00, 2:00 ET | Casper | Even hours |

Both monitor all three traders and attempt to fix — not just report. The watchdog checks: stale decisions (all HOLDs), journal freshness, risk state warnings, thesis quality, model timeout patterns.

### 30.4 Bootstrap Risk Gates

During bootstrap (first 30 closed trades or +5% equity, whichever comes first):

- **thesis**: WARNING only. Log empty thesis, proceed with trade. After bootstrap: VETO (<20 chars = reject).
- **signals_used**: WARNING only. Log missing signals, proceed. After bootstrap: VETO (empty array = reject).
- **exit_condition**: WARNING only. Default to "time_stop" if missing. After bootstrap: VETO.
- **holding_horizon_days**: Default to 5 if missing during bootstrap. After bootstrap: VETO.

This prevents the death spiral where: traders are too conservative → don't trade → when they finally try, risk veto rejects → still no trades → still no data → traders stay conservative. The bootstrap gate breaks this cycle by letting noisy trades through. Format correctness is valuable but secondary to having data to optimize against.

### 30.5 After-Hours Format Validation

Before every market open, each trader's prompt + HEARTBEAT must be tested through the actual model to verify it can produce valid JSON with all required fields.

**Test:** Send the full prompt + HEARTBEAT + simulated market context through the model. Validate the output:
- Parses as valid JSON
- Contains all required BUY fields: thesis (20+ chars), signals_used (array ≥ 1), exit_condition, holding_horizon_days, stop_loss, confidence
- OR produces a valid HOLD/SELL

**Schedule:** 8:00 AM ET, Mon-Fri. If any trader fails, block market open — fix the prompt first. A day with broken prompts is a day with zero data.

**Script:** `validate_prompt_format.py` in Hermes cron scripts. Model used: the same model each trader runs (kairos: flash, aldridge: pro, stonks: flash).
