Risk Management — spec-driven rebuild.

Composable risk gates. Each gate is a pure function:
    (context, action, timestamp=None) -> (granted: bool, reason: str)

Gates:
    CashGate       — can't spend > available cash
    PositionGate   — max N% portfolio in single position
    ExposureGate   — max N% total exposure
    PDTGate        — ≤N day trades in 5-day window
    HoursGate      — only trade 09:30–16:00 ET
    BootstrapGate  — bypass risk gates when portfolio is empty (bootstrap mode)

RiskManager chains gates in order and evaluates trades.
